# Visual Studio Code extension for dit

Language support, syntax highlighting, and linting for .dit files and dit statements.

Dit is a universal container file, which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/isaiahshiner/dit-cli).

Update to bring in line with the 0.5 'functions' release. Includes a very naive syntax highlighter. If you are interested in working on the syntax highlighter, please make a pull request! You can also send me a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7shhUxy).
